# PySQL
This is actually a python interface to mysql. It uses the mysql_connector_python module. Besides that it has a few other commands to explore as well. :)
Just do pip install -r requirements.txt before running the script.
Tested use,create, select and insert commands so far.
Comes with an embedded user manual. Do read it!
